# Eagle Justice League
We will be practicing how to structure HTML to create an informative web application about the Eagle Justice Team!


## Objective
To create a simple web application using **HTML elements** and style with CSS.


## Part 1 - HTML
>
## Set up
1. Clone this repository using the command line
2. Create a new file called `index.html`
>
## Your Challenge
1. In your `index.html` change the `title` of your web app in the `head` of your HTML structure to **Eagle Justice League**
>
2. Within the `body` of your HTML structure, create the following:
  + A `header` that contains the name of your team
  + A `paragraph` with your team's mission statement
  + An `unordered list` with the names of all your team members
  + Within each unordered list item, create an additional `unordered list` that details each team member's super power
  + Add an `image` of your team


_Note: Remember to make a commit after each html element is added!_

## Part 2 - CSS
>
## Set up
1. Create a new file called `styles.css`
2. Link your CSS file in your HTML
>
>
## Your Challenge
>
1. Using the `body` selector, change the following:
  + The _value_ of the _property_ **background-color** to a color of your choice
>
2. Using the `p` selector, change the following:
  + The _value_ of the _property_ **font-size** to `10px`
>
3. Using the `li` selector, change the following:
  + The _value_ of the _property_ **border-style** to `solid`
>
## _Bonus: Modify the values of 5 different element properties and make your image a 300px by 300px size._
